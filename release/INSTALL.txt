1. Compatibility:
=============================================================================
At this time Paperclip has only been tested on Series 5 & 5 MX but should be
compatible with all EPOC32 devices by Psion (and licensees).

Testing on real hardware is immensely helpful, so if you own any of the
following devices please send your experiences to kroc@camendesign.com

1.1: Series 5, 5 MX, 5 MX Pro, Ericsson MC218
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paperclip has been specifically designed for and tested on the Series 5 &
5 MX as those are the devices I own.

1.2: Revo, Revo+, Diamond Mako
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently untested. Paperclip does not [yet] adapt to the smaller screen
resolution, but will in future releases.

1.3: netBook, Series 7
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently untested. Whilst colour icons are provided, no special concessions
have been made for the larger screen size yet.

1.4: Geofox One, Osaris
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
All bets are off; I can't even emulate these machines! If you have one and
can test for me, please contact me at kroc@camendesign.com


2. Which Installer To Use:
=============================================================================
Paperclip comes with separate installation packages for different EPOC32
devices due to differences in machines which the installer is not smart
enough to handle (e.g. colour icons cannot be used on mono devices).

Currently, there are only two versions, but this may change in the future
with features tailored to specific hardware.

Paperclip_mono_v[...].sis

    For monochrome-screen devices: Series 5, 5 MX, 5 MX Pro,
    Ericsson MC218, Revo, Revo+, Diamond Mako, Osaris, Geofox One

Paperclip_color_v[...].sis

    For colour-screen devices: netBook, Series 7, netPad


3. Installation Via Compact Flash:
=============================================================================
The easiest method of getting Paperclip onto a physical device is to use the
Compact Flash slot present on most (but not all!) devices.

This section assumes that you are already proficient at using a Compact
Flash card to transfer files; read the next section if you want guidance
on what CF cards to use and compatibility concerns.

3.1 Copy Everything to Compact Flash Card
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's easiest to copy all files you've unzipped from the download to your
Compact Flash card. The location on the card is not important as you do not
need to retain the installation files after installing Paperclip

3.2 Access Compact Flash Card on Device
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Place the Compact Flash card in the device and turn it on.

Ensure that you are on the System (file explorer) screen by tapping the
"System" / EPOC-hand silk-screen icon outside of the screen area.

Navigate to the Compact Flash card, this is typically drive D. If your card
is formatted with multiple partitions these will be D, E, F... etc.

HINT: You can press Ctrl+Q to cycle through drives on the device

NOTE: The drive letter you see in Windows is not guaranteed to be the same
as on the device, particularly if your card has multiple partitions!

3.3 Install the Installer -- For Series 5 Only!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not all Series 5 devices have the on-board installer present and so cannot
run the Paperclip installer package! "Inst_te.exe" will fix that.

This only applies to Series 5 (ER1-ER3) devices. The on-board
installer is already present on 5 MX and later devices.

Open the "Inst_te.exe" file; nothing visible will happen,
but you will now be able to install software from the device.

3.4 Install Paperclip
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simply open the installation package (".sis") for your device, as listed
in Section 2; "mono" for monochrome-screen devices and "color" for colour-
screen devices.

Click through the pages of the installer to complete the installation.


4. Compact Flash Buyers Guide:
=============================================================================
Compact Flash represents the easiest (and cheapest!) method of transferring
files between the device and a modern computer, you won't even require
Windows!

History:    Compact Flash is an old memory-card format that has enjoyed
            surprising sticking power despite SD (and micro-SD) essentially
            'winning' the memory-card wars. Compact Flash's larger physical
            size was not a concern for professional camera users and the
            format offered far greater speed and capacities than SD in the
            early days. The offshoot of all of this is that Compact Flash
            is still commercially available and enjoys a staggering range
            of compatibility spanning from the early 90s to today

For the PC, you will need a Compact Flash card reader.

A USB Compact Flash reader is easy to use and very cheap. Older PCs from
the late 90s to the mid 2000s sometimes had multi card readers integrated
in a standard 3.5" bay. These 3.5" bay adaptors can still be purchased,
even brand new.
